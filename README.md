# Welcome to my data driven resume

## Why

An easier method of creating and maintaining my resume. Automation is essential to make sure our precious time is used doing other things like learning new skills or working on other projects. After all there is an opportunity cost in doing everything even crafting a killer resume. Now I can worry about the content of the resume letting **`R`** and $\LaTeX$ figure out the format.

## Acknowledgements

This Resume is created using the **`R`** Package [`vitae`](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) please check it out at their github repository. **Vitae** is an awesome package for creating resumes in **`R`**.

This is a fork of [tallguyjenks' cv](https://github.com/tallguyjenks/CV) and it was very helpful for understanding how the package works and the potential possibilities of crafting resumes in **`R`**.
